Project Title: Predictive Modeling using Logistic Regression.
This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning, to solve a binary classification problem.Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable that has two possible outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).
The model gives a good prediction accuracy and helps understand which features are important for the classification.
